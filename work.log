# put flickr api into neuraltalk2 docker image
Assume you have docker images from here https://github.com/beeva-enriqueotero/docker-neuraltalk2 for neuraltalk2
Then in the container
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh # to avoid mass with neuraltalk2 env
